## Project Overview
📝 **Description:** In this project, I've developed an Image QA_Bot using Google's GenerativeAI API. The bot can generate responses to questions based on the provided image. Users can capture an image from their webcam or upload an image. Then, they can input a prompt/question, and the bot will generate a response based on the image and the prompt.
Prompt is not mandatory, without the prompt the model will describe the provided image

## Model Details
🔍 **Generative Model:** Google's GenerativeAI API powers the bot to understand and generate responses based on the provided input image and prompt. The model used is `Gemini Pro Vision` and optimized for image-related question answering tasks.
